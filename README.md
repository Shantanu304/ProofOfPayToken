# ProofOfPay Token

## Project Title
ProofOfPay Token

## Project Description
ProofOfPay Token is a blockchain-based salary automation platform that tokenizes employee salaries and enables on-time payments through smart contract triggers. Developed using Soroban on Stellar, it creates and manages salary schedules with automated release conditions ensuring transparent, timely, and tamper-proof payroll processing.

## Project Vision
This project aims to streamline payroll and compensation in decentralized and traditional organizations by automating payments based on predefined schedules using smart contracts. ProofOfPay Token reduces delays, manual errors, and increases transparency in salary disbursements to enhance employee trust and financial management.

## Key Features
- Salary Schedule Creation: Employers define payment intervals, amounts, and employee details.
- Automated Payment Triggers: Contract enforces payment release only when due.
- Payment Tracking: Records all payment timestamps and statuses immutably.
- Schedule Management: Employers can deactivate or modify payment schedules.
- Immutable Records: Brings transparency with tamper-proof audit logs.
- Secure Authorization: Only authorized employers manage payment schedules.
- Real-time Queries: Check salary schedule and payment status anytime.

## Usage Instructions
1. Employers create salary schedules with all necessary terms.
2. Salary payments are triggered on time when the schedule matures.
3. Employers can manage and deactivate schedules as needed.
4. Employees and auditors query records for salary histories.

## Future Scope
- Integration with stablecoins and blockchain wallets for direct payments.
- Multi-employee batch payment processing.
- Payroll reporting and tax compliance modules.
- Mobile and web management interfaces.
- Escrow and dispute resolution for payment disagreements.

## Technology Stack
